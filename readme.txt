INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Detailed documentation is available at https://www.anuko.com/time_tracker/install_guide/index.htm

The general installation procedure looks like this:

- Install a web server and make sure it can serve HTML documents.
- Install PHP, configure your server to work with PHP scripts, and make sure it can work with PHP files. 
- Install the following PHP extensions: MySQL and GD. The GD extension is needed for pie-charts only.
- Install a database server such as MySQL and make sure it is working properly. 
- Install, configure, and test Anuko Time Tracker like so: 

1) Unpack distribution files into a selected directory for Apache web server.
2) Create a database using the mysql.sql file in the distribution.
3) If you are upgrading from earlier versions run dbinstall.php from your browser and do the required "Update database structure" steps.
4) Create user name and password to access the time tracker database. 
5) Change $dsn value in /WEB-INF/config.php file to reflect your database connection parameters (user name and password).
6) For UNIX systems set full access rights for catalog WEB-INF/templates_c/ (chmod 777 templates_c).
7) If you install time tracker into a sub-directory of your site reflect this in the APP_NAME parameter in /WEB-INF/config.php file. For example, for http://localhost/timetracker/ set APP_NAME = "timetracker".
8) Login to your time tracker site as admin with password "secret" without quotes and create at least one team.
9) Change admin password (on the admin "options" page). You can also use the following SQL console command: 
  update tt_users set password = md5('new_password_here') where login='admin'
  or by using the "Change password of administrator account" option in http://your_time_tracker_site/dbinstall.php

BLANK PAGES IN TIME TRACKER

If you see a blank page in when trying to access Anuko Time Tracker it may mean many things, among others, such as:

    * MySQL extension for PHP not installed or not working.
    * Time tracker database not created.
    * Access (login / password) to the database is not configured properly in config.php.
    * MySQL service is down. 
    * On UNIX systems - no full access rights for catalog WEB-INF/templates_c/ (chmod 777 templates_c).
